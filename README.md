# Amazon-Food-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
The Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset consists of 568,454 food reviews Amazon users left up to October 2012.

The purpose of this analysis is to make up a prediction model where we will be able to predict whether a recommendation is positive or negative. In this analysis, we will not focus on the Score, but only the positive/negative sentiment of the recommendation
